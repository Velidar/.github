# Velidar - Blind Spot Detection for Cyclists
### Developed by Younes Boujedli, Master BMC Innovation in Biotechnology, Sorbonne University

## Overview

The **Velidar** project was initiated by **Younes Boujedli** as part of the "Entrepreneurship Project" course in his second year of the Master BMC Innovation in Biotechnology at Sorbonne University. This innovative project aims to improve road safety for cyclists by addressing a key issue: the **feeling of insecurity** that prevents many people from using bicycles in urban environments.

Statistics show that around **60% of people** are reluctant to use bicycles due to safety concerns. This insight motivated Younes to develop **Velidar**, a **blind spot detection system** for bicycles, created in collaboration with Sorbonne University's **FabLab**.

The Velidar system seeks to **encourage urban cyclists** by reducing road hazards, allowing them to detect nearby vehicles and making cycling a safer and more appealing mode of transport.

## Product Description

Velidar is a **two-part system** designed to detect vehicles approaching from behind and provide real-time visual alerts to cyclists:

### 1. **Vehicle Detection Module**
- **Placement**: Mounted on the bike's seat post.
- **Functionality**: Has a **wide detection angle**, ensuring a broad coverage of the cyclist's surroundings.

### 2. **Signal Visualization Module**
- **Placement**: Attached to the bike's handlebar for easy visibility.
- **Functionality**: The **danger level** is calculated by the detection module and visually represented on the LED bar. This system allows cyclists to easily gauge the level of risk at a glance.

## Vision and Goals

The primary mission of Velidar is to **promote the use of bicycles** in urban areas by **enhancing road safety**. By offering cyclists a practical solution to one of the most common hazards—vehicles approaching from behind—the Velidar system aims to **boost confidence** and **reduce accidents**, contributing to the wider adoption of cycling as a daily mode of transportation.

Velidar is not just an idea—it's a **working prototype** that has already been recognized and awarded for its innovative approach to cyclist safety. The project is continuing to receive support and mentorship from **Pépite Sorbonne**, as it moves towards full development and commercialization.
